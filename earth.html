     <h2> Earth is not flat, but it's not perfectly round either !</h2>
      <p>
         Earth has never been perfectly round. The planet bulges around the equator 
         by an extra 0.3 percent as a result of the fact that it rotates about its axis. 
         Earth's diameter from North to South Pole is 12,714 kilometers (7,900 miles), 
         while through the equator it is 12,756 kilometers (7,926 miles). The difference — 
         42.78 kilometers (26.58 miles) — is about 1/300th the diameter of Earth. This 
         variation is too tiny to be seen in pictures of Earth from space, so the planet 
         appears round to the human eye. Recent research from NASA's Jet Propulsion 
         Laboratory suggests that melting glaciers are causing Earth's waistline to spread.

    <!-- Fact No 2  -->
    <div class="FactOnEarthNo2">
      <h2>The days are getting longer.</h2>
         <p>
            The length of Earth's day is increasing. When Earth was formed 4.6 billion 
            years ago, its day would have been roughly six hours long. By 620 million 
            years ago, this had increased to 21.9 hours. Today, the average day is 24 
            hours long, but is increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds every century. The 
            reason? The moon is slowing down Earth's rotation through the tides that it 
            helps create. Earth's spin causes the position of its tidal ocean bulges to 
            be pulled slightly ahead of the moon-Earth axis, which creates a twisting 
            force that slows down Earth's rotation. As a result, our day is getting longer 
            — but not long enough to make a difference to your busy schedule.

    <!-- Fact No. 3 -->
    <div class="FactsOnEarthNo3">
        <h2>There weren't always several continents.</h2>
        <p>
            Earth's continents have had an on-again, off-again relationship that has lasted
             for millions of years. Some 800 million years ago the great tectonic plates that 
             Earth's land masses ride upon came together, assembling the continents into a 
             large supercontinent called Rodinia; what is now North America lay at the center 
             of it. Rodinia eventually broke apart into many pieces that re-collided 250-500 
             million years ago, creating the Appalachian Mountains in North America and the 
             Ural Mountains in Russia and Kazakhstan.

            About 250 million years ago, the continents came together once again to form 
            another supercontinent called Pangaea, surrounded by a single, worldwide ocean. 
            Fifty million years later, Pangaea began to break apart. It split into two large 
            land masses — Gondwanaland and Laurasia — that ultimately fragmented into the 
            continents we know today.
        </p>

        <h2>Earth's icy times</h2>
        <p>
            About 600-800 million years ago, Earth underwent several extreme climate 
            changes known as ice ages. The climate became so cold that some scientists 
            believe Earth nearly or completely froze several times; this is known as the 
            "snowball Earth" theory. There may have been four such periods of alternate 
            freezing and thawing, triggered by reductions in greenhouse gases such as 
            methane and carbon dioxide, during which Earth would have been covered by 
            glacial ice from pole to pole. Because most of the sun's energy would have 
            been reflected back into space by ice, the planet's average temperature would 
            have been about -50 degrees Celsius (-74 degrees Fahrenheit), with the equator
             akin to Antarctica today. If snowball Earth did exist — a point that is hotly 
             contested — luckily we weren't around to feel the chill, as only microscopic 
             and simple organisms existed then.

        </p>

        <h2>The driest place on Earth</h2>
        <p>
            Ironically, the driest place in the world — the Atacama Desert in northern 
            Chile — is next to the biggest body of water — the Pacific Ocean. Average 
            annual rainfall in Arica, Chile, is just 0.8 millimeters (0.03 inches). It is 
            believed that Atacama's Calama city saw no rain for 400 years until a sudden 
            storm fell in 1972. Unlike most deserts, the Atacama is relatively cold and, 
            in its most arid parts, does not even host cyanobacteria — green 
            photosynthetic microorganisms that live in rocks or under stones. NASA 
            astrobiologists travel to the Atacama to look for microorganisms that live in 
            such an extreme environment, hoping to learn how life might exist on other 
            planets.

        <h2>Earth's gravity isn't uniform</h2>
        <p>
            If Earth were a perfect sphere, its gravitational field would be the same 
            everywhere. But in reality, the planet's surface is bumpy, and water flow, ice 
            drift and the movement of the tectonic plates beneath Earth's crust all change 
            the pull of gravity. These variations are known as gravity anomalies. A mountain 
            range such as the Himalayas causes a positive gravity anomaly — gravity is stronger 
            there than it would be on a featureless perfectly smooth planet. Conversely, the 
            presence of ocean trenches, or dips in the land caused by glaciers millennia ago, 
            leads to negative gravity anomalies. NASA's GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate 
            Experiment) mission, orbiting above us, is mapping Earth's gravitational field in 
            unprecedented detail.

        <h2>In the past, sea levels were very different</h2>
        <p>
            The most recent advance of ice on planet Earth began about 70,000 years ago, 
            ended 11,500 years ago and reached its farthest extent 18,000 years ago. 
            During this time, glaciers and sheets of ice carved out the basins of the 
            Great Lakes and blocked rivers, diverting the courses of the Mississippi and 
            other rivers in the U.S. So much water was trapped as ice that sea levels 
            dropped by as much as 120 meters (390 feet), exposing parts of what is now the 
            ocean floor. Earth's sea level has also been up to 70 meters (230 feet) higher 
            in the past. During the last interglacial period, the sea was actually 5 to 7 
            meters (16 to 23 feet) higher than it is today.

        <h2>Our sun has a voracious appetite</h2>
        <p>
            All stars, like our sun, age and eventually die. As the sun exhausts its 
            supply of hydrogen, it will collapse under gravity, ultimately ballooning into 
            a red giant that is 100 times bigger and 2,000 times more luminous, vaporizing 
            Earth in the process. But don't worry; it won't happen for about five billion 
            years.

           One option is to leave the planet before this happens, but that would require 
           as yet unimagined technology and a habitable destination. The other possibility
           is that, over the next few billion years, a passing star could disrupt Earth's
            orbit and kick it away from the sun. Scientists have suggested the odds of this 
            are one in 100,000 — better than winning the lottery. Unfortunately, left without 
            a sun our descendants would probably end up freezing to death.

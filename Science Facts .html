             <h2>
              Your height is not same in moring and eveing !
             </h2>
                 Measure yourself in the morning, then again at night. 
                 You’re going to be taller in the morning because of how 
                 the cartilage in your bones compresses during the day. 
                 Thanks a lot, gravity!

             <h2>
                Do you know your highest blood flow is in your kidneys !
             </h2>
                 The highest blood flow isn’t in your heart, liver, or 
                 brain — it’s in your kidneys. That’s because kidneys 
                are the body’s natural filtration system.  
                                  
             <h2>
                Affect of media in your daily life !
             </h2>
               12% of people dream in black and white. What’s weirder 
               is that human beings used to sleep and dream in black 
               and white even more before color tv (~15%). The average 
               person still dreams in color, but it’s interesting to 
               see how the human brain is susceptible to media.  
                                  
             <h2>
                Your blood vessels could circle the globe !!  
             </h2>
                  Though people have small blood vessels, the networking 
                  is amazingly long. If they were laid out they would 
                  measure more than 60,000 miles. Please don’t do that 
                  though, it’s good to keep your vessels in your body.
                                  
              <h2>
                   In time your brain has a harder time with long-term 
                   memories !
              </h2>
                   In time, your brain will have a harder time with long-term 
                   memory because the brain is unable to filter and remove old 
                   memories — which prevent it from absorbing new ideas. That 
                   means the brain has to work harder to produce memories over 
                   the average lifetime. 

              <h2>
                   Your skin has 1000 different species of bacteria on it
              </h2> 
                  Your skin is vital in protection of the body against 
                  bacteria (the skin itself has 1000 different species of 
                  bacteria on it at any given time), which is why the outer 
                  ayer of your skin continually renews itself. The entire 
                  process of skin cell renewal takes about 28 days.
